# Pilot Plan - November 2025

## Objective

Validate the multiagent system effectiveness during November 2025 pilot phase.

## Success Metrics

### Productivity

Measure:
- Time saved on repetitive tasks
- Reduction in context switching
- Faster task completion
- Less cognitive load

Target: 20% productivity improvement

### System Usage

Track:
- Daily agent interactions
- Agent activation distribution
- Most used workflows
- Context switch frequency

Target: Daily active usage, balanced agent distribution

### Quality

Monitor:
- Task completion accuracy
- Schedule adherence
- Notion data consistency
- Agent response quality

Target: 95% accuracy, zero data corruption

## Timeline

### Week 1 (Nov 1-2)

Focus: Initial setup and testing

- Day 1 (Sat): System setup, first interactions, heavy usage (recording sprint)
- Day 2 (Sun): Continue usage, first observations, weekly planning

Deliverables:
- System fully configured
- All 4 agents tested
- Initial feedback collected

### Week 2 (Nov 3-9)

Focus: Daily workflow integration

- Test morning routines
- Validate study session support (FIAP Fase 3)
- Check work maintenance tasks
- Monitor content planning and recording sessions

Deliverables:
- Daily usage patterns documented
- First refinements implemented
- Workflow optimizations

### Week 3 (Nov 10-16)

Focus: Optimization and automation

- Refine agent triggers
- Optimize delegation logic
- Improve response quality
- Add automation rules

Deliverables:
- Optimized agent configurations
- Background automation working
- Performance improvements

### Week 4 (Nov 17-23)

Focus: Advanced features

- Test complex workflows
- Multi-agent coordination
- Edge case handling
- Documentation updates

Deliverables:
- Advanced features validated
- Edge cases documented
- System stability confirmed

### Week 5 (Nov 24-30)

Focus: Final evaluation

- Collect metrics
- Analyze improvements
- Document learnings
- Plan next phase

Deliverables:
- Pilot report
- Metrics analysis
- Future roadmap
- Decision: Continue or adjust

## Key Performance Indicators

### Daily

- Agent interactions count
- Response time
- Error rate
- User satisfaction

### Weekly

- Tasks completed
- Time saved estimate
- Notion updates count
- Context switches

### Monthly

- Total productivity gain
- System uptime
- Feature usage stats
- Overall satisfaction

## Evaluation Criteria

### Must Have (Critical)

- System runs daily without issues
- Agents activate correctly
- Notion integration works reliably
- No data loss or corruption
- Privacy maintained

### Should Have (Important)

- Productivity improvement measurable
- Context switching works smoothly
- Background automation functional
- Documentation complete

### Nice to Have (Bonus)

- Advanced workflows implemented
- Metrics dashboard
- Community interest
- Potential for open source sharing

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk: System instability

Mitigation:
- Maintain backup of all configs
- Keep manual workflows available
- Regular testing
- Quick rollback capability

### Risk: Privacy breach

Mitigation:
- .gitignore properly configured
- Regular audits of commits
- Separate private repo option
- No sensitive data in public repo

### Risk: Low adoption

Mitigation:
- Make system easy to use
- Clear value proposition
- Quick wins early
- Iterate based on feedback

## Daily Log

Track daily:

```markdown
## Nov 1 (SÃ¡bado)
- Agents used: [list]
- Tasks completed: [count]
- Issues: [any problems]
- Notes: [observations]

## Nov 2 (Domingo)
- Agents used: [list]
- Tasks completed: [count]
- Issues: [any problems]
- Notes: [observations]
```

Location: `logs/pilot-daily.md`

## Weekly Review

Every Sunday:

1. Review week's usage
2. Collect metrics
3. Identify issues
4. Plan improvements
5. Update documentation

## End of Pilot

### Decision Points

After November, decide:

1. **Continue:** System is valuable, keep using
2. **Refine:** Needs improvements, iterate
3. **Expand:** Add more features, integrations
4. **Open Source:** Make public framework available
5. **Discontinue:** Not providing value (unlikely)

### Final Deliverables

- Pilot report with metrics
- Lessons learned document
- Refined system configurations
- Public framework (if decided)
- Future roadmap

## Success Definition

Pilot is successful if:

- Used daily throughout November
- Measurable productivity gain
- System runs reliably
- Documentation is complete
- Ready to recommend to others
