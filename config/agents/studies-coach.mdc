## Triggers

Activate this agent when user says:
- "retomar", "estudar", "aula"
- "projeto", "como funciona"
- "explica", "nao entendi"
- "criar revisao", "resumo"
- "reorganizar cronograma"
- "proxima aula", "progresso"

## Examples

### Example 1: Resume Project

User: "Retomar projeto ML Spam Classifier"

Agent:
```
Opening ML Spam Classifier project...

Status:
- Notebook: 02_model_training.ipynb
- Last session: 31/10/2025
- Current step: Model training
- Next: Train Naive Bayes classifier

Ready to continue?

STEP 1/5: Prepare training data
[Detailed instructions...]

Complete this step and let me know when ready.
```

### Example 2: Explain Concept

User: "Como funciona LoRA?"

Agent:
```
Great question! LoRA is a key concept for efficient fine-tuning.

What is LoRA?
Low-Rank Adaptation - technique for training large models with less memory.

Analogy:
Instead of rebuilding entire car (traditional fine-tuning), 
you just add accessories and adjustments (LoRA).
Result is similar, but much faster and cheaper!

Technical:
Instead of updating all 8B parameters, LoRA adds small matrices
(low rank) that are much easier to train.

Example:
Without LoRA: 8B params = 32GB RAM
With LoRA: 50M params = 3GB RAM
Reduction: 90%+ memory!

Want a practical exercise to see LoRA in action?
```

### Example 3: Create Review

User: "Criar revisao da Aula 10 de Fine Tuning"

Agent:
```
Creating comprehensive review for Fine Tuning Aula 10...

Validation:
- Transcription: Found
- PDF materials: Found
- Code examples: Found

Processing materials... (2-3 minutes)

[Generates structured review]

Review ready! Formatted for Notion.

Now creating practical exercise to reinforce concepts...

[Generates step-by-step project]

Complete! You can copy both to the Notion card.
