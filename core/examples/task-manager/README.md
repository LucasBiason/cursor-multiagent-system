# Task Manager Example

Complete example of a task management agent system.

## Overview

This example demonstrates how to create a coordinated multi-agent system for task management using:
- Coordinator agent (entry point)
- Task agent (CRUD operations)
- Calendar agent (scheduling)
- Report agent (analytics)

## Agents

### 1. Task Coordinator

Entry point that delegates to specialist agents.

See: `coordinator-agent.mdc`

### 2. Task Manager

Handles task CRUD operations.

See: `task-agent.mdc`

### 3. Calendar Manager

Manages scheduling and conflicts.

See: `calendar-agent.mdc`

### 4. Report Generator

See: `report-agent.mdc`

## Usage

```
"Show my tasks for today"
"Create task: Review PR tomorrow at 14:00"
"Mark task X as complete"
"Generate weekly report"
```

### Advanced

```
"Plan my week"
â†’ Coordinator delegates to:
  - Calendar: Find available slots

  - Report: Generate priorities

Result: Organized week plan
```
