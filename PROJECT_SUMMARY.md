### Private Configuration (Gitignored)

Contains:
- Personal agent configurations
- Notion database IDs
- User context and preferences
- Sensitive workflows
- Private rules

### Separation Strategy

- `.gitignore` protects all sensitive data
- Public parts can be shared/open sourced
- Private parts stay local or in separate private repo
- Clear documentation of what goes where

---

## Documentation Created

### Main Docs
- README.md - Project overview
- ARCHITECTURE.md - System design
- QUICK_START.md - 10-minute setup
- COMO_COMECAR.md - Usage guide
- PILOT_PLAN.md - November pilot plan

### Technical Docs
- GETTING_STARTED.md - Detailed setup
- RULES_SYSTEM.md - All rules documented
- CONTRIBUTING.md - Contribution guide

### Supporting Docs
- CHANGELOG.md - Version history
- LICENSE - MIT license
- Multiple README.md in subdirectories

---

## Rules Extracted

All rules from existing contexts consolidated:

### Timezone
- Always GMT-3 (Sao Paulo)
- Never UTC
- Format: 2025-11-01T19:00:00-03:00

### Notion
- Check duplicates before creating
- Validate properties
- Update status correctly
- Icons separate from titles

### Scheduling
- Study hours: 19:00-21:00 (hard limit 21:00)
- Work hours: 08:00-17:00 (Tue until 16:00)
- Recording: 21:00-00:00
- Respect timeboxes

### YouTube Production
- Focus on launch date (not recording date)
- Always have week recorded
- Batch production (weekends)
- Fastest series first
- Edit in small breaks

### Task Verification
- Ignore statuses: Concluido, Cancelado, Realocada, Descartado, Publicado
- YouTube special logic for editing statuses
- Check Launch Date for YouTube (not Period)

---

## Privacy Implementation

### Protected via .gitignore

All these are NOT in git:
- config/private/**
- config/agents/*-personal.mdc
- config/agents/*-work.mdc
- config/config.json
- Notion IDs
- API keys
- Personal schedules
- Medical details
- Work specifics

### What IS in Git

Only public, reusable parts:
- Framework code
- Generic templates
- Documentation
- Examples
- Utilities

**Privacy 100% guaranteed!**
